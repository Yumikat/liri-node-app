# liri-node-app

Runs in the terminal, with the commands entered from the user.
To run, just run the liri.js file with node - "node liri.js"

To make it run certain commands, you would enter the following after "node liri.js":

concert-this
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says

Then add whatever artist/concert, song, or movie after the previous command.

The app will then use NPM to pull information that the user requested.
